# Dear GitHub/Microsoft,

The launchers I placed in this folder require you to log in with your Microsoft or Mojang account. They include an option to create a non-premium account, but this option will only appear after you log in with your Microsoft/Mojang account.

I wanted to add your launcher, but the installation requires administrator privileges. (The repository is for students who have regular user accounts, not administrator accounts.)
